## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

This challenge I am feeling a lot more comfortable writing CSS and HTML than the last. I know I still have a lot to learn and I know I can most definetly improve the functionality of the HTML by using bootstrap more effectively, which I will continue to learn and update this project at a later time. I wanted to get the Desktop Version looking good, the mobile verison looks okay, with the exception that each card has different values for the border radius.


### Continued development

To be updated.
